	Spyric's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for Solar2D is similar to the
	standard UUID, but the identifiers that are generated by this plugin are of
	varying lengths and they are intended to be used to identify specific
	installations of a particular Solar2D developer's apps.
	
	Spyric Installation Identifier consists of three parts:

	1) Platform identifier.
		A single letter to identify the user's platform.
		"a" = Android
		"i" = iOS
		"w" = Win32
		"m" = MacOS
		"h" = HTML5
		"t" = tvOS

	2) Epoch (unix) time.
		Retrieved using socket.gettime() (or os.time() for HTML5 builds).
		With sockets, the epoch time will be fractional and the dot will
		be replaced by a hyphen (-) in the final UUID.
			
	3) Time to execution.
		How many milliseconds have passed between when this file was
		first required and when the UUID is generated.

		NB! For the best possible result, you should require this UUID
		plugin at the very start of your main.lua. That way, more time
		will pass before you create the UUID, which will result in a
		more random UUID. Requiring any plugins, modules or libraries,
		such as ad networks, Composer, Physics, JSON, etc. will each
		take at least some milliseconds or tens of milliseconds to
		complete. This, paired with epoch time, makes UUID more
		unique than most UUID implementations for Lua.
		
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	The only possible case where two users could have the same UUID is if
	they started your application at the same time, down to a millisecond
	(or down to a second if sockets aren't supported), and if the users
	are running the app on the same platform, and had identical times to
	execution. In other words, if properly set up, the probability of
	having two UUIDs for your app collide/overlap is practically zero.
