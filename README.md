# Spyric Games - Public Solar2D Plugins
A small collection of open source plugins for [Solar2D](https://solar2d.com/) created by [Spyric Games](https://www.spyric.com/).

Each plugin can be found within their corresponding sample project, inside the `spyric` folder. These plugins are just self-contained Lua modules.

For documentation, please visit [https://docs.spyric.com/](https://docs.spyric.com/).

At the current time, most of the plugins created by Spyric Games are closed source and used in client work or internal projects. Many of these plugins will be made available for other Solar2D developers in due time.
