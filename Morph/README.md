### Closing remarks
As this module is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/XeduR/spyricMorph/blob/master/LICENSE), you don't need to provide me with credits or anything like that for using this module, but as a fellow Corona developer, I would be happy to hear if my projects are actually helping others. So, feel free to drop by the Corona forums to say hi or send me an email!
